                    Scrap material purchasing refers to the activity of collecting used, damaged, or obsolete materials,
                    products,
                    equipment, or goods that are no longer directly usable, with the purpose of recycling, reusing, or
                    further processing
                    them. These materials, commonly referred to as scrap, come in various forms and types. They include
                    metals such as iron,
                    steel, aluminum, copper, stainless steel, and lead; non-metals such as paper, plastic, rubber, textiles,
                    and glass; as
                    well as discarded electronic devices, old components, machinery, and vehicles. The scrap material
                    purchasing process
                    plays a crucial role in waste reduction, resource conservation, and sustainable production practices.

        <h2>2. Purpose and Benefits</h2>
        <p class="technology scheduled">2.1 Resource Recycling
        Recycling scrap materials is a crucial solution for conserving raw materials and reducing the extraction of natural
        resources. By reprocessing and reusing used materials, industries can minimize their dependence on primary sources such
        as metal ores, wood, and petroleum. For instance, recycling scrap aluminum requires only about 5% of the energy needed
        to produce aluminum from bauxite ore, making it highly energy-efficient. Similarly, recycling one ton of paper can save
        approximately 17 mature trees, significantly reducing deforestation. The clear benefits of recycling include a reduction
        in the extraction of minerals, wood, and fossil fuels, decreased energy consumption in raw material production, and the
        preservation of valuable natural resources for future generations.
        2.2 Environmental Protection
        Recycling also plays a vital role in protecting the environment by limiting waste generation and reducing greenhouse gas
        emissions and pollution. When scrap materials are not properly collected and processed, they can end up in landfills or
        the environment, leading to soil, water, and air contamination. Toxic substances found in batteries, electronic
        components, and plastics can persist in the environment for hundreds of years. Recycling helps reduce the volume of
        landfill waste, conserves landfill space, and prevents the release of harmful emissions from waste incineration, such as
        dioxins and furans. It also minimizes greenhouse gas emissions like CO‚ÇÇ and CH‚ÇÑ associated with new production processes
        and reduces water pollution caused by leachate from landfills. For example, recycling one ton of aluminum can cut down
        approximately 9 tons of CO‚ÇÇ emissions, significantly benefiting the environment.
        2.3 Economic Value Creation
        Scrap material purchasing and recycling contribute significantly to economic value creation by offering profit
        opportunities for both individuals and businesses. Households can sell used items and scrap materials to generate
        additional income, while businesses can reduce storage costs by disposing of excess inventory and obsolete machinery.
        Recycling companies purchase these materials and reintroduce them into the production cycle, forming a circular economy.
        Governments also benefit from reduced waste management costs and decreased reliance on imported raw materials. As an
        example, a scrap purchasing company that recycles hundreds of tons of copper and aluminum annually can earn millions in
        revenue by selling these materials back to manufacturers.
        2.4 Contributing to the Development of the Recycling Industry
        The recycling of scrap materials plays a key role in supplying raw materials for manufacturing plants, fostering the
        growth of a sustainable and circular economy. Recycled metals such as copper, iron, steel, and aluminum are widely used
        in the production of components, machinery, and construction materials. Recycled plastics serve as inputs for packaging,
        furniture, and construction products, while recycled paper is repurposed for printing, packaging, and office supplies.
        This process not only supports industrial production but also has broad social and economic impacts. It creates millions
        of jobs in the collection, sorting, processing, and recycling sectors, drives the development of environmentally
        friendly industries, and stimulates technological innovation and production efficiency.</p>

        <h2>Target Audience and Collection Locations</h2>
        <p class="technology">We offer a comprehensive waste collection and processing service for individuals and households, ensuring the proper
        disposal and recycling of various types of waste. Our services include the management of specially classified household
        waste, which includes items that require careful handling. These items are: old fluorescent bulbs, used small batteries
        and accumulators, used oils and fats (if any), and used cleaning agents or chemicals. Such materials need to be disposed
        of properly to avoid environmental damage and potential health risks.
        In addition to specially classified waste, we also collect recyclable scrap materials from households. These materials
        can either be bought from households or accepted for free, depending on their condition. Recyclable items include scrap
        paper, old newspapers, PET plastics, plastic cans, plastic boxes, aluminum cans, steel, and other old metal materials.
        These materials are important for reducing waste sent to landfills and can be processed and reused in various
        industries, promoting sustainability.
        We also handle the collection of broken household electronic devices, which include items such as fans, old computers,
        televisions, refrigerators, and other household appliances. These electronic devices are often difficult to dispose of
        and may contain hazardous components. We ensure that these items are properly dismantled, sorted, and sent to
        specialized facilities for recycling or disposal, following environmental guidelines. Our goal is to make waste
        management easier for households while contributing to a cleaner and greenerenvironment.</p>
