          We provide a wide range of advanced wastewater treatment technologies, tailored to different types of wastewater and
          specific treatment requirements. One of the prominent technologies is the Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR). This system
          uses bio-media freely suspended within the reactor tank, where microorganisms adhere to the surface of the media and
          form a biofilm that biologically degrades pollutants in the wastewater. MBBR offers high treatment efficiency, handles
          high organic loads, ensures stable operation, and allows for easy scalability. It is widely applied in domestic and
          industrial wastewater treatment‚Äîsuch as in food processing, textile dyeing, and seafood processing industries‚Äîand is
          also effective in nitrogen and phosphorus removal.
          
          Another cutting-edge solution is the Membrane Bioreactor (MBR), which integrates biological treatment using activated
          sludge with membrane filtration, typically ultrafiltration (UF) or microfiltration (MF). The membranes, with their fine
          pore size, effectively retain suspended solids, bacteria, and viruses, resulting in high-quality effluent suitable for
          reuse in various applications. MBR technology offers superior effluent quality, requires a compact footprint, ensures
          stable performance, and reduces sludge production. It is especially suitable for urban domestic wastewater treatment,
          hospital wastewater, and industrial wastewater that demands high effluent quality.
          
          In addition, we employ physico-chemical treatment technologies, which utilize methods such as coagulation, flocculation,
          sedimentation, filtration, adsorption, and ion exchange to remove specific pollutants from wastewater. These
          technologies are particularly effective in removing non-biodegradable substances such as heavy metals, oils and greases,
          dyes, and nutrients. Depending on the wastewater characteristics, these methods are often used as pre-treatment or
          secondary treatment steps. They offer significant advantages, including the ability to adjust pH, treat
          hard-to-biodegrade compounds, and effectively remove suspended solids. Common applications include treatment of
          industrial wastewater containing heavy metals, highly colored wastewater, and oily wastewater requiring pre-treatment.

<div class="harmless col-12">
  <p class="technology">
    We provide effective solutions for controlling and reducing air pollution from industrial activities through advanced
    technologies. One such method is Adsorption Technology, which uses adsorbent materials like activated carbon or zeolite
    to capture gaseous pollutants such as VOCs, SOx, NOx, and H‚ÇÇS on the surface of the material. Over time, the adsorbent
    is either regenerated or replaced. This method offers high efficiency in treating low-concentration pollutants and has
    the potential for recovering valuable compounds. It is widely applied in exhaust gas treatment in industries such as
    painting, printing, chemical manufacturing, and pharmaceuticals.
    Another solution is Thermal Oxidation (Combustion) Technology, where organic pollutants in exhaust gases are incinerated
    at high temperatures, converting them into harmless substances like CO‚ÇÇ and H‚ÇÇO. This can be done through direct thermal
    oxidation or catalytic oxidation. This technology is highly effective in treating a broad spectrum of organic pollutants
    and is commonly used for VOC treatment from manufacturing plants and emissions from incinerators.
    Lastly, we offer Biological Treatment Technology, which utilizes microorganisms to biologically degrade organic
    pollutants in exhaust gases. This eco-friendly method is particularly suitable for waste gases with low pollutant
    concentrations and high flow rates. It features low operating costs and is effectively used for odor control and gas
    treatment at wastewater treatment plants, as well as for treating exhaust gases from organic fertilizer production
    facilities.

    <h2>3 Waste management technology</h2>
    <p class="technology">We aim for sustainable waste treatment solutions that minimize landfill waste and maximize resource utilization through
    advanced technologies. One key solution is Waste-to-Energy Incineration Technology, in which household or industrial
    waste, after being properly sorted, is incinerated in modern, high-efficiency furnaces to generate heat. This heat is
    then converted into electricity, creating a renewable energy source. This technology offers the significant advantage of
    reducing the volume of waste sent to landfills while simultaneously generating energy. It is widely applied in the
    treatment of urban household waste and the disposal of non-recyclable industrial waste.
    Another essential solution is Recycling Technology, which involves sorting and processing waste to recover valuable
    materials such as metals, plastics, paper, and glass. These materials are then recycled into new products, contributing
    to a circular economy. Recycling helps conserve natural resources, reduces environmental pollution, and yields products

        Project 1: Wastewater Treatment System at VSIP Industrial Park ‚Äì Nghe An,<br>
        implemented by Nghe An Environmental Joint Stock Company:
      </h4>
      <p class="technology secondary">
        The wastewater treatment project, invested by the VSIP Nghe An Industrial Park Management Board, was implemented at the
        VSIP Industrial Park in Hung Nguyen District, Nghe An Province. With a total duration of 11 months, from May 2022 to
        April 2023, the project was designed to treat up to 4,000 cubic meters of wastewater per day. The scope of work
        encompassed the complete design of the treatment system, construction and installation of all components, equipment
        setup, trial operation, and system handover. The implementation process began with a thorough survey and data collection
        on the existing wastewater sources, followed by the preparation of technical design documents in accordance with
        Vietnamese environmental regulations and VSIP-specific guidelines. The construction phase included building key
        structures such as the reaction tank, aeration tank, sedimentation tank, and the control building. To ensure effective
        treatment of pollutants like COD, BOD, suspended solids (SS), and heavy metals, a combination of biological and chemical
        treatment technologies was applied. During the equipment installation phase, modern devices including air blowers, water
        pumps, pipelines, and an automated PLC control system were installed, allowing for continuous monitoring and compliance
        with wastewater quality standards. The final phase involved conducting trial operations, fine-tuning the system to meet
        QCVN 40:2011/BTNMT standards, and training operational staff before handing over the fully functional treatment system
        to the investor. Throughout the project, images were documented to illustrate the overall station, construction
        progress, equipment installation, and technical training sessions.

        would like to extend our warmest greetings to our valued customers.
        The collection, transportation,
        and treatment of hazardous waste are among the tasks regulated 
        by both law and environmental standards.

        as this issue directly affects human health and the ecosystem.
        For this reason, our company has made a firm commitment
        to invest in infrastructure and equip itself with modern technology
        to meet these societal demands.
