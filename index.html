      <p class="main col-13 ">We provide a wide range of advanced wastewater treatment technologies, tailored to different types of wastewater and
      specific treatment requirements. One of the prominent technologies is the Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR). This system
      uses bio-media freely suspended within the reactor tank, where microorganisms adhere to the surface of the media and
      form a biofilm that biologically degrades pollutants in the wastewater. MBBR offers high treatment efficiency, handles
      high organic loads, ensures stable operation, and allows for easy scalability. It is widely applied in domestic and
      industrial wastewater treatment‚Äîsuch as in food processing, textile dyeing, and seafood processing industries‚Äîand is
      also effective in nitrogen and phosphorus removal.
      Another cutting-edge solution is the Membrane Bioreactor (MBR), which integrates biological treatment using activated
      sludge with membrane filtration, typically ultrafiltration (UF) or microfiltration (MF). The membranes, with their fine
      pore size, effectively retain suspended solids, bacteria, and viruses, resulting in high-quality effluent suitable for
      reuse in various applications. MBR technology offers superior effluent quality, requires a compact footprint, ensures
      stable performance, and reduces sludge production. It is especially suitable for urban domestic wastewater treatment,
      hospital wastewater, and industrial wastewater that demands high effluent quality.
      In addition, we employ physico-chemical treatment technologies, which utilize methods such as coagulation, flocculation,
      sedimentation, filtration, adsorption, and ion exchange to remove specific pollutants from wastewater. These
      technologies are particularly effective in removing non-biodegradable substances such as heavy metals, oils and greases,
      dyes, and nutrients. Depending on the wastewater characteristics, these methods are often used as pre-treatment or
      secondary treatment steps. They offer significant advantages, including the ability to adjust pH, treat
      hard-to-biodegrade compounds, and effectively remove suspended solids. Common applications include treatment of
      industrial wastewater containing heavy metals, highly colored wastewater, and oily wastewater requiring pre-treatment.</p>

    We provide effective solutions for controlling and reducing air pollution from industrial activities through
    advanced technologies.
  </p>

  <p>
    Adsorption Technology: This method uses adsorbent materials like activated carbon or zeolite to capture gaseous
    pollutants such as VOCs, SOx, NOx, and H‚ÇÇS on the surface of the material. Over time, the adsorbent is either
    regenerated or replaced. This method offers high efficiency in treating low-concentration pollutants and has the
    potential for recovering valuable compounds. It is widely applied in exhaust gas treatment in industries such as
    painting, printing, chemical manufacturing, and pharmaceuticals.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thermal Oxidation (Combustion) Technology: Organic pollutants in exhaust gases are incinerated at high temperatures,
    converting them into harmless substances like CO‚ÇÇ and H‚ÇÇO. This can be done through direct thermal oxidation or
    catalytic oxidation. This technology is highly effective in treating a broad spectrum of organic pollutants and is
    commonly used for VOC treatment from manufacturing plants and emissions from incinerators.
  </p>

  <p>
    Biological Treatment Technology: This method utilizes microorganisms to biologically degrade organic pollutants in
    exhaust gases. It is an eco-friendly approach, particularly suitable for waste gases with low pollutant
    concentrations and high flow rates. This method features low operating costs and is effectively used for odor
    control and gas treatment at wastewater treatment plants, as well as for treating exhaust gases from organic
    fertilizer production facilities.

        Project 1: Wastewater Treatment System at VSIP Industrial Park ‚Äì Nghe An,<br>
        implemented by Nghe An Environmental Joint Stock Company:
      </h4>
      <p>
        The wastewater treatment project, invested by the VSIP Nghe An Industrial Park Management Board, was implemented at the VSIP Industrial Park in Hung Nguyen District, Nghe An Province. With a total duration of 11 months, from May 2022 to April 2023, the project was designed to treat up to 4,000 cubic meters of wastewater per day.
        <br><br>
        The scope of work encompassed the complete design of the treatment system, construction and installation of all components, equipment setup, trial operation, and system handover. The implementation process began with a thorough survey and data collection on the existing wastewater sources, followed by the preparation of technical design documents in accordance with Vietnamese environmental regulations and VSIP-specific guidelines.
        <br><br>
        The construction phase included building key structures such as the reaction tank, aeration tank, sedimentation tank, and the control building. To ensure effective treatment of pollutants like COD, BOD, suspended solids (SS), and heavy metals, a combination of biological and chemical treatment technologies was applied.
        <br><br>
        During the equipment installation phase, modern devices including air blowers, water pumps, pipelines, and an automated PLC control system were installed, allowing for continuous monitoring and compliance with wastewater quality standards. The final phase involved conducting trial operations, fine-tuning the system to meet QCVN 40:2011/BTNMT standards, and training operational staff before handing over the fully functional treatment system to the investor.

  <h4>2. Project: Providing periodic environmental monitoring services for Saigon - Song Lam Brewery.</h4>
 <div class="machines ">
  
      <p >
        The investor of this project is Saigon - Song Lam Brewery Joint Stock Company. The scope of work includes periodic environmental monitoring covering wastewater, emissions, and noise in compliance with the regulations of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment. This is a long-term service contract that has been implemented since June 2021 and is still ongoing.
        
        The detailed activities comprise the collection of wastewater and emission samples at designated monitoring points, followed by sample analysis conducted at a VILAS-accredited laboratory. After the analysis, comprehensive monitoring reports are prepared to assess the current environmental status. In cases where monitored parameters exceed the permitted limits, consultancy on suitable treatment solutions is also provided.
        
        In practice, the project includes on-site sampling by trained staff, the use of modern monitoring equipment such as gas analyzers and automatic sampling machines, and the preparation of detailed analysis reports reflecting the sample results.
