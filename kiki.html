        <h3 class="technology stages">In celebration of World Environment Day, June 5th, 2023!</h3>
        <p class="technology field">In 2023, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) announced the theme for World Environment Day as
            'Solutions to
            Plastic Pollution', with a focus on implementing the campaign 'Beat Plastic Pollution'. According to UNEP's
            assessment,
            environmental pollution from plastic waste has become one of the most pressing issues that countries must
            address. Every
            year, the world produces approximately 400 million tons of plastic, half of which is single-use plastic, and
            less than
            10% is recycled. It is estimated that around 19 to 23 million tons of plastic waste are released into lakes,
            rivers, and
            oceans each year</p>
        <h3 class="terminology safety">Ngh·ªá An: Raising Community Awareness on Waste Sorting at Source!</h3>
        <p class="technology collaborated">The increasing amount of household waste is becoming a growing challenge for the environment and public
            health. Sorting
            waste at home and in public areas is considered one of the most effective solutions to reduce pressure on
            landfills,
            while also optimizing waste recycling and treatment.</p>
        <p class="technology mt-5 compact">Changing public awareness and raising people's consciousness about waste sorting at source is a challenging
            task that
            requires a long-term process, along with effective mechanisms for operation and violation handling. In
            reality, many
            localities have implemented this model, yet it has not yet led to sustainable change</p>

        <p class="technology catalytic">In Ngh·ªá An, in 2023, the total amount of household solid waste (HSW) in the province was about 1,051 tons per
            day, with
            urban areas contributing over 581 tons per day. The rate of HSW collection and treatment reached over 74%.
            By the end of
            August 2024, this rate had increased to 80%. Currently, the province has 5 enterprises, 9 public service
            units, 17
            cooperatives, and individuals involved in the collection, transportation, and treatment of HSW, with more
            than 60
            specialized waste compaction trucks, 54 various types of trucks, and 494 handcarts engaged in waste
            collection and
            transportation.
            In October, the Agricultural Extension Center (Department of Agriculture and Rural Development) collaborated
            with the
            Environmental Protection Department (Department of Natural Resources and Environment) to organize 3 training
            courses
            aimed at raising awareness on waste sorting at source, reducing the use of plastic, non-biodegradable
            plastic bags, and
            single-use plastics. These sessions were attended by 90 local residents from Nghi Kim Commune (Nghi L·ªôc),
            VƒÉn L·ª£i
            Commune, and H·∫° S∆°n Commune (Qu·ª≥ H·ª£p District).
            Through these activities, the campaign raised awareness in the local community about the dangers of plastic
            waste
            pollution and encouraged individuals to change their behavior and habits related to the use of plastic
            products and
            single-use plastic bags. The goal is to reduce environmental pollution, protect human health and ecosystems,
            and turn
            awareness into specific actions to limit the use of plastic and nylon products, replacing them with
            environmentally
            friendly alternatives. At the same time, the campaign highlighted the responsibility of local authorities
            and residents,
            addressing prohibited behaviors and administrative penalties related to environmental protection.
            Mr. Tr·∫ßn Qu·ªëc To√†n, head of C·ªìn T√¥ 3 Village (H·∫° S∆°n Commune), shared: 'In the past, people thought that
            waste sorting
            wasn‚Äôt essential, and just throwing everything together was fine. But after attending the training sessions
            and being
            educated on the benefits of waste sorting and the harms of improper waste management, my community and I now
            think
            differently. From now on, we will proactively sort our waste as instructed, limit the use of plastic and
            non-biodegradable plastic bags, and contribute to protecting a greener, cleaner, and more beautiful
            environment.'
            Mr. Tr·∫ßn Quang Nh·ª±t, Deputy Director of the Agricultural Extension Center, shared: 'Currently, in many
            places, awareness
            of waste sorting is still limited. Many residents do not fully understand the importance of this practice or
            have not
            been properly instructed on how to sort waste correctly. Sorting waste not only benefits the environment but
            also helps
            save costs on waste treatment and creates new resources, bringing social value by connecting the community
            through
            meaningful social activities.'

                <h3>Intensify communication and raise awareness on waste sorting at source.</h3>
                <p class="technology catalytic">Currently, 63 provinces and cities nationwide are implementing pilot models of waste sorting at source with varying
                degrees, starting with the establishment of model areas and expanding from there. Localities will proactively deploy
                based on the specific infrastructure of each area.
                Waste sorting at source is one of the most basic and simplest actions to protect the environment. In the future, to
                successfully and effectively implement the breakthrough provisions on waste sorting at source outlined in the 2020
                Environmental Protection Law, Mr. Ho√†ng VƒÉn Th·ª©c, Director of the Environmental Pollution Control Department, believes
                that all levels and sectors need to take decisive measures to mobilize all resources from the State, enterprises, and
                society; ensure that waste collection, transportation, and treatment equipment for household solid waste (HSW) is
                synchronized and meets environmental protection requirements.
                At the same time, efforts should be made to raise awareness about the significance of waste sorting at source and the
                potential risks if waste is not sorted, so that people can understand and implement it. Surveys and evaluations need to
                be conducted to categorize target groups and develop appropriate implementation strategies and roadmaps. It is also
                necessary to encourage and invest in equipment, funding, and human resources for waste sorting at source during the
                initial stages and for continuous andregular maintenance.</p>
