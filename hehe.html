                <p class="technology chemical">Nghe An Environmental Treatment Joint Stock Company offers expert consultation on selecting the most suitable waste
                treatment methods for various types of waste. For solid waste, we recommend solutions such as sanitary landfills,
                incineration, recycling, and composting, depending on the specific needs and environmental impact. For liquid waste, we
                employ biological treatment, chemical-physical treatment, and recycling for reuse to ensure effective and sustainable
                management. Hazardous waste is carefully classified, packaged safely, and treated by specialized units to prevent harm
                to the environment and public health. Household waste management focuses on source separation, efficient collection, and
                integration for recycling, making it easier to minimize waste and maximize resource recovery.
                Additionally, we develop comprehensive recycling plans to help save resources and reduce costs. Our approach involves
                assessing the recyclability of different waste types, organizing separate sorting and collection of recyclable
                materials, and choosing the most appropriate recycling technologies. Through these processes, we convert waste into
                valuable resources, including plastics, paper, organics, and more, contributing to environmental sustainability and circular economy goals.</p>
