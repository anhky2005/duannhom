        <p class="calculate">On the morning of March 24, Deputy Prime Minister Tr·∫ßn H·ªìng H√† chaired a meeting to listen to a report and provide
        feedback on the draft Decree amending and supplementing several articles of Government Decree No. 06/2022/Nƒê-CP, which
        regulates greenhouse gas emission reduction and ozone layer protection</p>
        <p class="calculate">The draft Decree is designed to provide detailed regulations on the provisions of the Environmental Protection Law, in
        line with the implementation of international climate change agreements.</p>

                    <h5 class="campaign">Deputy Prime Minister Tr·∫ßn H·ªìng H√† assessed that the draft Decree has gradually updated international developments,
                    practical experiences, and lessons learned - Photo: VGP/Minh Kh√¥i.</h5>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p class="half">The provisions in the draft Decree aim to strengthen greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory, assess inventory results, and
            reduce GHG emissions; promote decentralization, delegation of authority, and streamline administrative procedures to
            reduce compliance costs for businesses in assessing inventory results, emission reduction, and allocation of emission
            quotas.
            The ministries managing relevant sectors propose the annual allocation of emission quotas for each facility under their
            management. The Ministry of Agriculture and Environment will compile, submit to the Prime Minister for consideration,
            and approve the total GHG emission quotas for each phase and each year, after which the quotas will be allocated to the
            facilities.
            The draft Decree outlines the schedule for allocating GHG emission quotas in three phases: 2025-2026, 2027-2028, and
            2029-2030. In the first phase, allocations will be made to facilities with high emission levels in three sectors:
            thermal power, steel production, and cement production. It is expected that 150 facilities will be allocated quotas in
            the first phase, accounting for about 40% of the total national GHG emissions.
            The amendments also include improvements to the carbon market regulations, aiming to adjust and update the rules on the
            parties involved in the exchange of emission quotas and carbon credits. The content will include the establishment of a
            National Emission Quota and Carbon Credit Registration System for management purposes; detailed regulations on the
            exchange of emission quotas and carbon credits on trading platforms; and the implementation of mechanisms for domestic
            carbon credit exchange and offsetting.
            Relevant ministries will approve and recognize the processes and technical standards for creating carbon credits,
            project registration, changes in project participants, project deregistration, and the issuance of carbon credits for
            projects under their jurisdiction.
            The draft Decree also introduces new administrative procedures for the assessment of GHG inventory results for
            facilities allocated emission quotas, managed by the relevant ministries. The procedures for carbon credit exchange and
            offsetting within the country are streamlined, reducing the number of parties required to confirm carbon credits and
            simplifying the administrative procedures for confirming emission quotas.
            Regarding ozone layer protection, the draft Decree proposes amendments to improve six articles and appendices, covering:
            controlled ozone-depleting substances and their management roadmap, the exclusion of controlled ozone-depleting
            substances; registration and reporting of controlled substance usage; allocation, adjustment, and supplementation of
            production and import quotas for controlled substances; the process for allocating, adjusting, and canceling production
            and import quotas for controlled substances; collection, recycling, reuse, and treatment of controlled substances; and
            responsibilities for managing controlled substances.</p>

                <p class="landfill">At the meeting, leaders of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the Ministry of Construction, and the Ministry of Finance
                suggested the need for regulations, criteria, methodologies, and criteria for selecting organizations and independent
                consulting experts to carry out greenhouse gas emissions inventories and verify results related to emissions, ensuring
                objectivity, fairness, and transparency. They also emphasized the need to develop a set of criteria for allocating
                emission quotas for different sectors, regions, and businesses, and to ensure the coherence of emissions quota and
                carbon credit regulations with international standards, especially for businesses, as well as the quality of emission
                quotas and carbon credits traded in the carbon market.
                Minister of Agriculture and Environment ƒê·ªó ƒê·ª©c Duy stated that the spirit of designing and building the draft Decree is
                to "run while setting the stage," meaning the process is ongoing while continuously updating and adding new issues to
                keep pace with domestic and international changes.
                "The Decree is designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as a societal issue, divided by sector, field, and
                transboundary. It will control emissions based on the emission sources, provide solutions to reduce emissions, and
                create carbon credits. The ministries and sectors will implement measures first, summarize, and draw lessons before
                delegating to local authorities," Minister ƒê·ªó ƒê·ª©c Duy shared.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="technology">At the conclusion of the meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Tr·∫ßn H·ªìng H√† assessed that the draft
        Decree has gradually
        updated international trends, practical realities, and existing experiences; reflecting Vietnam's commitment to
        international agreements on greenhouse gas emissions reduction; and has garnered significant attention from domestic
        businesses, as well as international trade partners and organizations.
        However, as this is a technical decree, it is still subject to many fluctuations and changes. Therefore, the
        Ministry of
        Agriculture and Environment must thoroughly understand the specialized legal system and international agreements,
        while
        providing a framework and guiding principles with a "sandbox" approach to continue updating technical issues that
        may
        still evolve.
        "This is a new field that requires new administrative procedures to implement state management functions, but they
        must
        be as simple and streamlined as possible. You need to carefully study and calculate the decentralization plan,
        starting
        with assigning the management responsibilities to the relevant ministries and sectors," said the Deputy Prime
        Minister,
        emphasizing that "the content, concepts, terminology, and drafting techniques in the draft Decree must be
        scientific,
        clear, and easy to understand so that businesses and citizens can clearly grasp and implement them."
        The Deputy Prime Minister further clarified that the Decree aims to implement the general policy of gradually
        investing
        in technology, management, and enhancing measures to absorb emissions reductions, while also ensuring that
        Vietnamese
        products can compete in the global market. Therefore, the regulations on standards, methods, and policies must align
        with international practices, while closely following the standards of each market, sector, and business type, "not
        in a
        rigid, uniform manner, but flexibly and diversely depending on the market, ranging from the highest and most
        stringent
        standards to the most flexible."
        Additionally, the Decree must decentralize responsibilities, delegating ministries and sectors to develop and issue
        technical regulations and standards related to emission quotas, carbon credits; the conditions for establishing and
        the
        operational mechanisms of independent consulting organizations and experts responsible for measuring, recording,
        verifying, accrediting, and reporting greenhouse gas emissions data and carbon credits that are recognized and
        mutually
        accepted by international organizations and partners.
        The Deputy Prime Minister also provided feedback on the regulation of carbon credits as goods in the carbon market,
        the
        decentralization of emission quota management to specialized ministries, the application of technology, and the
        digitization of management and operations in all activities related to emissions and carbon credits.</p>
